## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### API Integration
- The app fetches weather data from [Weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/) using the following endpoints:
  - **Current Weather API**: Fetches the current weather data.
  - **7-Day Forecast API**: Fetches the weather forecast for the next week.

### Data Parsing
- Weather data is fetched in JSON format and decoded using `Codable` structs.
- All data is managed via a `WeatherViewModel` using the `@Published` property wrapper for real-time updates.

### Dynamic UI
- Weather conditions dynamically influence:
  - Background animations (using Lottie).
  - Icons for weather conditions (fetched from Weatherbit's API).
  - Temperature and weather descriptions.

## Configuration ‚ö°

1. **API Key**:
   - Sign up on [Weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/) to get your API key.
   - Add your API key to `WeatherViewModel`:
     ```swift
     let apiKey = "your-weatherbit-api-key"
     ```

2. **Icons and Animations**:
   - Weather icons are fetched from Weatherbit's static assets.
   - Animations are integrated using Lottie.
