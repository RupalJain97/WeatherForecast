## Technology and Structures

This Weather App was developed to explore and implement various iOS technologies and patterns, including:

- **Swift MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** Followed the MVVM architecture to separate the UI layer (View) from business logic (ViewModel), promoting cleaner and more testable code.
- **URLSession**: Used for handling network data transfer tasks to fetch real-time weather data and 3-day forecasts.
- **RESTful API**: Integrated the Weatherbit API to fetch detailed weather information for over 376,000 cities.
<!-- - **Core Animation**: Implemented smooth and interactive animations for enhanced user experience. -->
<!-- - **Auto Layout**: Utilized SwiftUI's layout tools for responsive and adaptive design. -->
- **Lottie**: Incorporated engaging animations using the Lottie framework to enhance visual appeal.
- **Web Services**: Handled data flow between the app and the Weatherbit API.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### API Integration
- The app fetches weather data from [Weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/) using the following endpoints:
  - **Current Weather API**: Fetches the current weather data.
  - **3-Day Forecast API**: Fetches the weather forecast for the next week.

### Data Parsing
- Weather data is fetched in JSON format and decoded using `Codable` structs.
- All data is managed via a `WeatherViewModel` using the `@Published` property wrapper for real-time updates.

### Dynamic UI
- Weather conditions dynamically influence:
  - Background animations (using Lottie).
  - Icons for weather conditions (fetched from Weatherbit's API).
  - Temperature and weather descriptions.

## Configuration ‚ö°

1. **API Key**:
   - Sign up on [Weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/) to get your API key.
   - Add your API key to `WeatherViewModel`:
     ```swift
     let apiKey = "your-weatherbit-api-key"
     ```

2. **Icons and Animations**:
   - Weather icons are fetched from Weatherbit's static assets.
   - Animations are integrated using Lottie.
